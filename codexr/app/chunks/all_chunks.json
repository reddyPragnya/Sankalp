Without occlusion, geometry in your scene will always render on top of physical objects in the AR background, regardless of their difference in depth.\nMore specifically, the AR Occlusion Manager acquires per-frame images from the AR platform containing depth or stencil data that shaders can use to implement the occlusion effect. Incorporating depth images into the rendering process allows shaders to sample both the depth of your Unity scene and the depth of the physical environment, and render the pixels that are closer to the camera.\nAR Occlusion Manager component.\nAdd required components to your scene\nTo enable occlusion, add the\nAROcclusionManager\nto your\nCamera\nas outlined in\nManagers\n.\nFor ARKit, ARCore, or XR Simulation, you must also add the\nAR Camera Background component\nto your camera.
